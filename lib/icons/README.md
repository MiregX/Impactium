# @impactium/icons

This package provides a convenient wrapper around `lucide-react` and `vercel-icons`. It includes over 1900 icons, making it easy to use them in your projects.

### Key Features
- **Default Size:** Icons have a default size of `16`.
- **Default Color:** Default `color` value is `currentColor`.
- **Color Priority:** The `color` property takes precedence over `variant`.
- **Recommendation:** Avoid using universal CSS rules like `* { color: something }` as all icons will inherit that color. Instead use `*:not(svg *){}`
- **`@param fromGeist`:** Allows selecting an icon that exists in both libraries.

### Usage

```typescript
import { Icon } from '@impactium/icons';

// Basic usage
<Icon name="FunctionGo" />

// Setting color
<Icon name="FunctionGo" color="gray" />
<Icon name="FunctionGo" color="#212121" />

// Using variant
<Icon name="FunctionGo" variant="dimmed" />

// Example with TypeScript types
const name: Icon.Name = "FunctionNode";
const variant: Icon.Variant = "white";

<Icon name={name} variant={variant} size={32} />
```

### Changelog

- **1.0.8**:
  1. The default icon size has been updated from **20px** to **16px**.
  2. Fixed an issue with the built-in icon compiler from `lucide-react`. A custom algorithm was implemented to:
     - Support `defs` elements.
     - Work with nodes of any depth.
  3. Added support for the `fromGeist` parameter, allowing the selection of icons with the same name from both libraries. For example:
    - `<Icon name='User' />` // defaults to `lucide-react`.
    - `<Icon name='User' fromGeist />` // loads the icon from `Geist/Vercel`.
